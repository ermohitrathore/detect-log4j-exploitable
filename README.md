# CVE-2021-44228

An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.

This script will help to detect log4j exploit from the running process. It helps to find if any system is exploitable or not, without actully exploiting the code.

It will try to fetch process those using java and check for the log4j-core component.

Note: The script is written on bash, and using two packages(zip, unzip) which is required to run the script.
